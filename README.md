# Cover Time Based Component trigger script (RF) version
Cover Time Based Component for your [Home-Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io) based on [davidramosweb's Cover Time Based Component](https://github.com/davidramosweb/home-assistant-custom-components-cover-time-based), modified for covers triggered by RF commands, or any other unidirectional methods.

With this component you can add a time-based cover. You have to set triggering scripts to open, close and stop the cover. Position is calculated based on the fraction of time spent by the cover travelling up or down. You can set position from within Home Assistant using service calls. When you use this component, you can forget about the cover's original remote controllers or switches, because there's no feedback from the cover about its real state, state is assumed based on the last command sent from Home Assistant. There's a custom service available where you can update the real state of the cover based on external sensors if you want to.

You can adapt it to your requirements, actually any cover system could be used which uses 3 triggers: up, stop, down. The idea is to embed your triggers into scripts which can be hooked into this component via config. For example, you can use RF-bridge or dual-gang switch running Tasmota firmware integrated like in the examples shown below.

The component adds two services ```set_known_position``` and ```set_known_action``` which allow updating HA in response to external stimuli like sensors.

## Installation
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)
* Install using HACS, or manually: copy all files in custom_components/cover_rf_time_based to your <config directory>/custom_components/cover_rf_time_based/ directory.
* Restart Home-Assistant.
* Create the required scripts in scripts.yaml.
* Add the configuration to your configuration.yaml.
* Restart Home-Assistant again.

### Usage
To use this component in your installation, you have to set RF-sending scripts to open, close and stop the cover (see below), and add the following to your configuration.yaml file:

### Example configuration.yaml entry
```yaml
cover:
  - platform: cover_rf_time_based
    devices:
      my_room_cover_time_based:
        name: My Room Cover
        travelling_time_up: 36
        travelling_time_down: 34
        close_script_entity_id: script.rf_myroom_cover_down
        stop_script_entity_id: script.rf_myroom_cover_stop
        open_script_entity_id: script.rf_myroom_cover_up
        send_stop_at_ends: False #optional
        invert_knx_open_close: True #optional
        aliases: #optional
          - my_room_cover_time_based
```
All mandatory settings self-explanatory. 
Optional settings:
- `send_stop_at_ends` defaults to `False`. If set to `True`, the Stop script will be run after the cover reaches to 0 or 100 (closes or opens completely). This is for people who use interlocked relays in the scripts to drive the covers, which need to be released when the covers reach the end positions.
- `invert_knx_open_close` defaults to `True`. If set to `False` it will follow KNX inverted open close values: `0` meaning open and `100` meaning closed. Otherwise open/close values will follow HA Cover Template: `0` (closed) and `100` (open) 
- `aliases`: to override the entity name generated by Home Assistant internally from the (friendly) name. 


### Example scripts.yaml entry
The following example assumes that you're using an [MQTT-RF bridge running Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-RF-Bridge-433/) open source firmware to integrate your radio-controlled covers:
```yaml
'rf_myroom_cover_down':
  alias: 'RF send MyRoom Cover DOWN'
  sequence:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: 'cmnd/rf-bridge-1/backlog'
      payload: 'rfraw XXXXXXXXX....XXXXXXXXXX;rfraw 0'

'rf_myroom_cover_stop':
  alias: 'RF send MyRoom Cover STOP'
  sequence:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: 'cmnd/rf-bridge-1/backlog'
      payload: 'rfraw XXXXXXXXX....XXXXXXXXXX;rfraw 0'

 'rf_myroom_cover_up':
  alias: 'RF send MyRoom Cover UP'
  sequence:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: 'cmnd/rf-bridge-1/backlog'
      payload: 'rfraw XXXXXXXXX....XXXXXXXXXX;rfraw 0'
```

The example below assumes you've set `send_stop_at_ends: True` in the cover config, and you're using any [two-gang switch running Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-Dual-R2/) open source firmware to integrate your switch-controlled covers:
```yaml
'rf_myroom_cover_down':
  alias: 'Switches send MyRoom Cover DOWN'
  sequence:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: 'cmnd/myroomcoverswitch/POWER1' # open/close
        payload: 'OFF'
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: 'cmnd/myroomcoverswitch/POWER2' # power
        payload: 'ON'

'rf_myroom_cover_stop':
  alias: 'Switches send MyRoom Cover STOP'
  sequence:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: 'cmnd/myroomcoverswitch/POWER2' # power
        payload: 'OFF'
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: 'cmnd/myroomcoverswitch/POWER1' # open/close
        payload: 'OFF'

'rf_myroom_cover_up':
  alias: 'Switches send MyRoom Cover UP'
  sequence:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: 'cmnd/myroomcoverswitch/POWER1' # open/close
        payload: 'ON'
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: 'cmnd/myroomcoverswitch/POWER2' # power
        payload: 'ON'
```
(Credits to [VDRainer](https://github.com/VDRainer) for the code. Note how you don't have to configure these as switches in Home Assistant at all, it's enough just to publish MQTT commands strainght from the script.)
Of course you can customize based on what ever other way to trigger these 3 type of movements. You could, for example, turn on and off warning lights along with the movement.

### Services to set position or action without triggering cover movement.

This component provides 2 services:

1.  ```cover_rf_time_based.set_known_position``` lets you specify the position of the cover if you have other sources of information, i.e. sensors. It's useful as the cover may have changed position outside of HA's knowledge, and also to allow a confirmed position to make the arrow buttons display more appropriately.
1.  ```cover_rf_time_based.set_known_action``` is for instances when an action is caught in the real world but not process in HA, .e.g. an RF bridge detects a ```stop``` action that we want to input into HA without calling the stop command.


#### ```cover_rf_time_based.set_known_position```

In addition to ```entity_id``` and ```position``` takes 2 optional parameters:
* ```confident``` that affects how the cover is presented in HA. Setting confident to ```true``` will mean that certain button operations aren't permitted.
* ```position_type``` allows the setting of either the ```target``` or ```current``` posistion.

Following examples to help explain parameters and use cases:

1.  This example automation uses ```position_type: current``` and ```confident: true``` when a reed sensor has indicated a garage door is closed when contact is made:

```yaml
- id: 'garage_closed'
  alias: 'Doors: garage set closed when contact'
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - entity_id: binary_sensor.door_garage_cover
    platform: state
    to: 'off'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      confident: true
      entity_id: cover.garage_door
      position: 0
      position_type: current
    service: cover_rf_time_based.set_known_position
``` 

We have set ```confident``` to ```true``` as the sensor has confirmed a final position. The down arrow is now no longer available in default  HA frontend when the cover is closed. 
```position_type``` of ```current``` means the current position is moved immediately to 0 and stops there (provided cover is not moving, otherwise will contiune moving to original target). 


2.  This example uses ```position_type: target``` (the default) and ```confident: false``` (also default) where an RF bridge has interecepted an RF command, so we know an external remote has triggered cover opening action:

```yaml
- id: 'rf_cover_opening'
  alias: 'RF_Cover: set opening when rf received'
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.rf_command
    platform: state
    to: 'open'
  condition: 
  - condition: state
    entity_id: cover.rf_cover
    state: closed
  action:
  - data:
      entity_id: cover.rf_cover
      position: 100
    service: cover_rf_time_based.set_known_position
```

```confident``` is omitted so defaulted to ```false``` as we're not sure where the movement may end, so all arrows are available.
```position_type``` is omitted so defaulted to ```target```, meaning cover will transition to ```position``` without triggering any start or stop actions.

#### ```cover_rf_time_based.set_known_action```
This service mimics cover movement in Home Assistant without actually sending out commands to the cover. It can be used for example when external RF remote controllers act on the cover directly, but the signals can be captured with an RF brigde and Home Assistant can play the movement in parrallel with the real cover. In addtion to ```entity_id``` takes parameter ```action``` that should be one of open, close or stop.

Example:

```yaml
- id: 'rf_cover_stop'
  alias: 'RF_Cover: set stop action from bridge trigger'
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.rf_command
    platform: state
    to: 'stop'
  condition:[]
  action:
  - data:
      entity_id: cover.rf_cover
      action: stop
    service: cover_rf_time_based.set_known_action
```
In this instance we have caught a stop signal from the RF bridge and want to update HA cover without triggering another stop action.

### Icon customization
For proper icon display (opened/moving/closed) customization can be added to `configuration.yaml` based of what type of covers you have, either one by one, or for all covers at once:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  customize_domain: #for all covers 
     cover:
      device_class: shutter
  customize: #for each cover separately
    cover.my_room_cover_time_based:
      device_class: shutter
```

### Some tips when using this component with Tasmota RF bridge in automations
Since there's no feedback from the cover about its current state, state is assumed based on the last command sent, and position is calculated based on the fraction of time spent travelling up or down. You need to measure time by opening/closing the cover using the original remote controller, not through the commands sent from Home Assistant (as they may introduce some delay).

Tasmota is able to send out the radio-frequency commands very quickly. If some of your covers 'miss' the commands occassionally (you can see that from the fact that the state shown in Home Assistant does not correspond to reality), it may be that those cover motors do not understand the codes when they are sent 'at once' from Home Assistant. They are sent very quickly one after another and Tasmota can cope with that, however this can be too much for the motors themselves.
To prevent that, make sure you **don't use** [cover groups](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover.group/) containing multiple covers provided by this integration, and also in automation **don't include multipe covers separated by commas** in one service call. You should create separate service calls for each cover, moreover, add 1 second delay between them:
```yaml
- alias: 'Covers down when getting dark'
  trigger:
    - platform: numeric_state
      below: 400
      for: "00:05:00"
      entity_id: sensor.outside_light_sensor
  action:
    - service: cover.close_cover
      entity_id: cover.room_1
    - delay: '00:00:01'
    - service: cover.close_cover
      entity_id: cover.room_2
    - delay: '00:00:01'
    - service: cover.set_cover_position
      data:
        entity_id: cover.room_3
        position: 20
    - delay: '00:00:01'
    - service: cover.set_cover_position
      data:
        entity_id: cover.room_4
        position: 30
```
